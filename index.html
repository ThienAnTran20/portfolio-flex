            <h1>Hello. I'm Thien An Tran!</h1>
            <p>I am a Front End Web Developer located in New York, New York..
    
            <p>I graduated from Texas State University with a degree in Computer Science, but knowledge is a life long process.  My process brought me from Austin, Texas to the Big Apple, and it shows Iâ€™m a hard worker, a fast learner, and I can easily adapt to new challenges.</p>   
            <p>Please explore my website, and feel free to <a href="mailto:thienan@thienantran.com">Contact me!</a> </P>

        <h2>About me</h2>
        <div class='group'>
          <div class='item-double'>
           <p>I have been passionate about the web ever since it was in it early stage years ago when I was in college.  I always wanted to be a part of the vast team that contribute to it every day, and now, being able to do it is like a dream come true to me.</p>

           <p>Before getting into programming, I had worked in architecture, interior design, as well as ran a successful businesses, therefore, I strongly value teamwork.  I believe that with good collaboration, we can achieve more efficient results in less time.</p>

           <p>I like to build websites that are:</p> 
            <ol>
              <li>Easy to use</li>
              <li>Responsive</li>
              <li>Visually appealing</li>
            </ol>  

           <p>My great hobby besides work is playing music, as I can play both guitar and piano. Every time I played with other musicians, I would ask them to sign my guitar as a souvenir.  You can say that my guitar is one of the favorite things that I own.</p>
